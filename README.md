# Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF)

From Wikipedia: IPF is an iterative algorithm for estimating cell values of a contingency table such that the marginal totals remain fixed and the estimated table decomposes into an outer product. Here we fit it using the method described on the Wikipedia page as well as a poisson regression.
